Caveats:
"1. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd-expanded.html#Not Stated."
"2. The population figures for years 2022 and later are single-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage"
"2022 postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 22, 2023. The 2022 series is based on the Modified Blended Base"
"produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial population count. The Modified Blended Base consists of"
"the blend of Vintage 2020 postcensal population estimates for April 1, 2020, 2020 Demographic Analysis Estimates, and 2020"
"Census data from the internal Census Edited File (CEF). The population figures for years 2021 are single-race estimates of the"

"4. Beginning with the 2018 data, changes have been implemented that affect the counts for ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99"
"compared to previous practice. In addition, data for the cause of death codes O00-O99 for 2003 through 2017 reflect differences"
"in information available to individual states and probable errors. Caution should be used in interpreting these data. More"
"information can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/maternal-mortality/."
"5. Between December 22, 2020 and February 3, 2021, the county-level race-specific population figures and rates reported for year"
"2018 were inaccurate for queries that reported race-specific categories for single race 6 Race groups in combination for any"
"specific County and/or Urbanization categories. The results to such queries erroneously reported inaccurate population values"
"and death rates for specific 6 Race categories at the county level. This problem applied to all queries with County and/or"
"Urbanization categories and the specific 6 Race categories in year 2018. We apologize for this error."
"6. On March 11, 2021, the 2019 mortality data on CDC WONDER was updated with the 2019 mortality data updated by NCHS on March 4,"
"2021 to include corrected information for residents of Texas affecting 5 records previously coded to cause code *U01.4,"
"Terrorism involving firearms (homicide). The underlying and multiple cause of death codes for 5 records were corrected in the"
"2019 data. Underlying and multiple cause of death codes for those 5 records were recoded to Assault (homicide) by other and"
"unspecified firearm discharge, ICD-10 code X95. The corrected final death records replaces the data released on December 22,"
"2020."
